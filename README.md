# [Candlestick](https://candlestickers.app/)

Candlestick is a fork of Wick Editor, a free and open-source tool for creating games, animations, and everything in-between.

### Getting Started

We plan to update our Node packages in the future. Until then, you will need to use Node Version 14 to install the right packages. If using an M-series Mac, this will require installing Rosetta 2.

See the original Wick Editor [README](https://github.com/Wicklets/wick-editor/blob/master/README.md) for older instructions.
Newer instructions are provided below, with a focus on Mac development. If you're a Windows user, look at [StickmanRed](https://github.com/StickmanRed)'s guide [here](https://github.com/StickmanRed/wick-editor/discussions/40). You should still read these instructions first, though.

### 1. Homebrew
This is optional as you can download things without, but Homebrew is a simple set of command line tools that make the process easier. We recommend downloading it if you haven't already. 
Quick Homebrew check:—
```
brew --version
```
If nothing returns you can download it with [this command](<https://brew.sh/>)
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### 2. Node Version Manager
<sup>(nvm = Node Version Manager)</sup>

nvm is a CLI library that helps you manage the Node versions you have installed on your device. You should be able to [install Node versions directly from online](<https://nodejs.org/en/download>).
Run a quick nvm check to see if you have it installed—
```
nvm ls
```
This command lists all the node versions you have. If you installed the node version without nvm then the command may not catch the node you have installed or it may not even be downloaded at all. 
To install nvm, you can follow the steps here:
https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating

Or just paste this command into your terminal:
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash
```
which downloads the nvm code to an nvm directory on your system. Try running `nvm ls` or `nvm --version` afterwards, and if you get nothing from both then go back to [this link](<https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating>) and follow the instructions.

<sup>If you're on Windows, please see [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).</sup>

### 3. Installing Node
Wick Editor uses the active version of Node, 24.

Ensure you're on the correct Node version using `nvm`: 
```
nvm install 24
```

### 4. Final step, setup and run
You need to navigate to your project file... if you don't know how to navigate through the terminal then you may use [this online video tutorial](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgBd6rjuDQ>) to learn how. It's simple but takes a minute to explain.

If you haven't downloaded our repository yet then do that by either downloading the zip, or using `git clone`
```
git clone https://github.com/Candlestickers/Candlestick.git
cd Candlestick
```
-#(You may also need to download git first using `brew install git`, or [download Git through this online website](https://git-scm.com/install/))

If you have the repository set up, then navigate to the directory and run the following command to install the npm packages:
```
npm install
```

Once you have everything setup, all you need to do to test your app is... first build the engine:
```
npm run build-engine
```
<sup>^ You'll also need to do this step every time you make changes to your `/engine` directory to be able to see changes</sup>

Then create a production build of the project:
```
npm run build
```
<sup>^ This command is not always needed while testing, you'll need it most prior to deploying your code because it's basically just an optimisation command you don't need to use much</sup>

And lastly, to run your project in development:
```
npm start
<sup>^ Instead of the usual procedure of running build-engine and then running npm start you can just type npm run engine-quickrun instead :)</sup>
```

If it worked, you should see something like this in the terminal.
```
Compiled successfully!

You can now view Candlestick in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000/
  On Your Network:  http://###.###.#.###:3000/
```
If you go to your browser and open up [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) you should find the project there. You can also test on your mobile devices by going to the network `http://###.###.#.###:3000/` link on another device *connected to the same network* (it should work, but if it doesn't, it could be due to certain network restrictions).

Well that's all!
